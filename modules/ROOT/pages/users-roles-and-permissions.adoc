Anypoint Platform comes with predefined roles and permissions that can be set in the Access Management to provide users with different access levels. API Experience Hub has permissions for administrators, consumers, and Exchange viewers.

== Consumer Users
API Experience Hub has the following consumer user profiles:

* Guest
* Member

These are groups of users with certain permissions that are managed using the Teams feature in Access Management. Permissions for Guest and Member users are automatically determined by how they access an organization's portal. A user who does not log in to the portal is an anonymous user that is assigned the guest user profile with the permissions assigned to this group. A guest user can become a member by completing the registration process for the portal. Once the user's registration is approved, this user inherits the member user profile and it's associated permissions. See xref:access-management::access-managements/teams.adoc[Manage User Access Using Teams] for more information about Teams in Access Management.

|===

== Administrator Roles and Permissions

The Organization Administrator role has all of the permissions necessary to create, curate, manage, and customize a portal. This role can also grant another user in their organization the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. This permission allows the user to do all of the same tasks in the portal as the Organization Administrator.

 If there is more than one user who intends to curate and manage the portal, the Organization Administrator can grant another user the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator permission. This administrator has fewer permissions in the portal than the Organization Administrator and the API Experience Hub Administrator.
