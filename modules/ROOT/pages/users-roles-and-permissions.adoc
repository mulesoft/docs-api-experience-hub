Anypoint Platform comes with predefined roles and permissions that you can set in Access Management to manage users with different access levels. API Experience Hub has permissions for administrators, consumers, and Exchange viewers. For more information, see xref:access-management::access-management/managing-permissions.adoc[Managing Permissions in Access Management].

== Consumer Users
API Experience Hub has the following consumer user profiles:

* Guest
* Member

These are groups of users with certain permissions that you can manage using the Teams feature in Anypoint Access Management. Permissions for Guest and Member users are automatically determined by how they access an organization's portal. A user who does not log in to the portal is an anonymous user that is assigned the guest user profile with the permissions assigned to this group. A guest user can become a member by completing the registration process for the portal. Once the user's registration is approved, this user inherits the member user profile and its associated permissions. See xref:access-management::access-managements/teams.adoc[Manage User Access Using Teams] for more information about Teams in Access Management.

|===
|User Profile |Description |Actions
|Guest| This userâ€™s profile is anonymous and is not logged in the API portal.

== Administrator Roles and Permissions

The Organization Administrator role has all of the permissions necessary to create, curate, manage, and customize a portal. This role can also grant another user in their organization the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. This permission enables the user to do all of the same tasks in the portal as the Organization Administrator.

//If there is more than one user who intends to curate and manage the portal, the Organization Administrator can grant another user the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator permission. This administrator has fewer permissions in the portal than the Organization Administrator and the API Experience Hub Administrator.

Once your Anypoint organization is linked to your Salesforce organization, two admin teams are created:

* API Experience Hub Admin team
+
Any user who is assigned as the API Experience Hub Administrator is automatically added to this team in Access Management.
* API Experience Hub Portal Admin team
+
Any user assigned as the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator is automatically added to this team in Access Management. Although this team is visible in Access Management, this permission cannot be assigned to a user in this release.

Administrators can only add APIs for which they have the Exchange Viewer permission. When APIs are added to the portal, all administrators are automatically assigned the Exchange Viewer permission. 

Administrators enter the Salesforce Experience Builder with a shared user account. The identity of the administrator is shared therefore API Experience Hub cannot determine the individual administrator's action in the shared account. If the administrator is already logged in to the Salesforce organization, they lose their previous session when they click the *Preview portal in Salesforce Builder* button.
