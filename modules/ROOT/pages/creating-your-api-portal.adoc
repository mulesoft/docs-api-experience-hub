A guided setup takes you through the process of creating your API portal using out-of-the-box templates. The guided set up contains basic set up options for the Home, API catalog, and API Details pages with an example layout to help you visualize your portal. After the portal is created, you can further customize it using the Experience Builder. 

NOTE: Currently, the preview of your API portal is a static HTML page that populates an example portal and does not reflect your actual portal selections.

The guided setup has the following components:
