Users who access an API portal without logging in cannot perform most actions in the portal, like requesting access to APIs to use them. Becoming a member gives you access to more APIs and functionality. Anyone can sign up for an account to become a member. A welcome email is sent to you that contains a link to set up your account and password.

To register for an account:

. In a browser window, enter the URL of the portal.
. Click *Log in*.
. Click *Not a Member?*.
. Enter your first name, last name, and email address.
. Click *Sign Up*.
. Follow the directions in the welcome email to set up your account.
