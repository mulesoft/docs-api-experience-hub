API Experience Hub uses Salesforce Chatter Feed components to enable collaboration with members of an API portal community by:

* Sharing posts and updates
* Participating in polling
* Asking questions 
* Receiving notifications for relevant activities in personalized feeds

The Chatter Feed options that display depend on how your administrator sets up feeds for the API portal.

To see feedback and discussions about an API:

. Select an API from the *Home* or *APIs* page of the portal. 
. In the *API details* page, select the *Feedback and discussions* tab.
+
*Feedback and discussions* is the default of name of the tab, however, administrators can change this name.
