= Configuring SSO When No Identity Provider Is Configured in Anypoint Platform
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This use case includes all of the instructions for setting up an identity provider for your portal when no other identity provider is configured in Anypoint Platform. You want to configure an identity provider as a login option for your portal. Since there is no identity provider configured in Anypoint Platform, the default identity provider automatically maps the identity provider for the portal to the identity provider in Anypoint Platform. This enables every Salesforce user to have an identity in Anypoint Platform. See xref:enabling-sso-for-your-portal.adoc#out-of-the-box-configurations[Out-of-the-Box Configurations] for more information about the default identity provider.

== Before You Begin
* In the identity provider of your choice, the users or identities must be created for the group of the users who have access to the application. 

* Review the information in the xref:enabling-sso-for-your-portal.adoc#before-you-begin [Before You Begin] section to understand the roles and permissions required and the information that API Experience Hub expects to configure custom user attributes and claims for the identity provider.

== Step 1: Enable SSO for Your Portal
To enable SSO, an identity provider is required for Anypoint Platform to create identities in Anypoint Platform for Salesforce users. 

In this step, you create an application in the identity provider for the API Experience Hub portal, enable the ability to send group information in the application configuration, configure groups, and configure the default identity provider. Performing these steps require you to move back and forth between applications and the identity provider application to copy or add information. 

=== Create and Configure an Application Using One of the Following Example Methods:

* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect
* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta SAML

==== Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect

[%collapsible]
====

Create a new application for the API Experience Hub portal in the identity provider using OpenID Connect. 

. In Okta, create an OpenID Connect Web application. For more information, see https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm[Create OIDC app integrations^].
. From the *General Settings* section, complete the following fields:
+
[%header,cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Field|Value
|*App integration name*|Enter a name for the app.
|*Grant type* |Select *Authorization Code*.
|*Assignments* |Select *Limit access to selected groups*.
|*Selected group(s)*|Enter the name of the group who must have access to the application.
|===
. Verify that your identity provider sends the expected claims listed in the   xref:enabling-sso-for-your-portal.adoc#before-you-begin[Before You Begin] section. 
. Configure the claims that the application sends.
+
For example, for OpenID Connect for Okta, you can configure the groups claim using the following steps:

.. From the *Sign On* tab, click *Edit* from the *OpenID Connect ID Token* section.
.. From *Groups claim type*, select *Filter*. 
.. From *Groups claim filter*, enter `groups`.
.. Select *Matches regex for the expression* then enter `.*` for wildcard.
+

. Configure an authentication provider for Salesforce using OpenID Connect.
//make this a partial to include in all use cases (ran out of time - Post GA)
+
You set up the auth provider or SSO settings in Salesforce with the identity provider application information.

.. From the OpenID Connect application, get these configuration values:

* *Client ID*
* *Client Secret*
* *Authorize Endpoint URL*
* *Token Endpoint URL*
* *User Info Endpoint URL*

.. In *Salesforce*, go to *Setup*.

|===
image::aeh-salesforce-auth-provider.png[Salesforce Auth. Provider example]
.. Click *Save*. 

. Configure the redirect URIs for the portal.
+
To configure the redirects, use your 15 digit organization ID and 18 digits org ID and add a URL for each organization ID.

.. In the Okta application, select the *General* tab.
Add the following URLs for *Sign-in redirect URIs*:    
+
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${15DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${18DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.site.com/aeh/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}
+

== Step 2: Add Salesforce Identity Providers 
//make this a partial to include in all use cases (ran out of time - Post GA)
After the identity provider is configured for Salesforce, add and enable the identity provider from the API Experience Hub UI. When the identity provider is enabled, users can log in to the portal using this identity provider.

. Go to *API Experience Hub > User management*.
. From the *User management* page, select the *Login settings* tab.
. From the *Single sign-on (SSO)* section, scroll down to step 2 *Add Salesforce identity providers*.
. Click *Select identity provider* and select an option from the drop-down menu. 
. Click *+ Add identity provider*.
. Move the slider to *Enabled*.

[[add-group-mapping]]
== Step 3: Add Group Mappings 
//make this a partial to include in all use cases (ran out of time - Post GA)
When setting up SSO for the portal, your users must have an identity in both Salesforce and Anypoint Platform. SSO users are mapped to teams using their group names. You must map your users to teams using Access Management. API Experience Hub provides an out-of-the-box team called *AEH Portal - ${salesforceOrganizationId}_${salesforceCommunityId}* that is added automatically as a team in Access Management.

Add group mappings by adding the user to the corresponding profile in API Experience Hub:

. Go to *Access Management* > *Teams*.
. Click *AEH Portal Guests* and click *AEH Portal Members*.
. Click *External IdP Groups*.
. From the *Group Name* field, enter *AEH Members*.
. From the *Provider Name* field, select the name of the corresponding Salesforce identity provider.
. From the *Type* field, select *Member* and click *Add*.
+
image::aeh-sso-access-mgmt-ext-idp-groups.png[Access Management group mapping]
. Click *Save Changes*.
+
The SSO users associated with the group you designated are assigned to the team.

[[test-sso]]
== Step 4: Test the SSO Configuration
//make this a partial to include in use case 2 and 3(ran out of time - Post GA)
Verify that the SSO for the portal is configured properly.

. In a browser, open an incognito window.
. Go to your API Experience Hub portal.
. Select the SSO option that you configured.
. Log in with a user that belongs to the group you configured in the identity provider for your portal.
. Check the visibility of APIs for the user in the portal.
. Go to *Access Management* and select *Users*. 
. Search using the username to confirm that the user is mapped to the expected identity provider.
. Go to the team with the configured group mappings. 
+
From the *Members* tab, ensure that you can see your user there.
