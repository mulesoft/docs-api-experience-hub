= Use Case 1: Configuring Single Sign-On When No Identity Provider is Already Configured
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Use case one includes all of the instructions for setting up an identity provider for your portal when no other identity provider is not configured in Anypoint. You want to configure an identity provider as a login option for your portal. Since there is no identity provider configured in Anypoint, you don’t need to map the identity provider for the portal to the identity provider in Anypoint since the default identity provider can be used for the portal. This enables every Salesforce user to have an identity in Anypoint.

== Step 1: Enable SSO for Your Portal
To enable SSO, an identity provider is required for Anypoint to create identities in Anypoint for Salesforce users. 

In this step, you create an application in the identity provider for the API Experience Hub portal, enable the ability to send group information in the application configuration, configure groups, and configure the default identity provider. Performing these steps require you to move back and forth between the application and the identity provider application to copy or add information. These steps can vary depending on your use case, especially when adding or reconciling username assignments. 

NOTE: This use case uses Okta as an identity provider as an example of how to enable SSO, however, you can use any identity provider.

== Prerequisites

In the identity provider of your choice, create the user or identity the group of the users who have access to the application. 

== Create and set up an application using one of the following example methods:

* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect
* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta SAML


=== Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect

[%collapsible]
====

Create a new application for the API Experience Hub portal in the identity provider using OpenID Connect. 

. In Okta, create an OpenID Connect Web application. For more information, see https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm[Create OIDC app integrations^].
. From the *General Settings* section, complete the following fields:

|===
|Field|Value
|*App integration name*|Enter a name for the app.
|*Grant type* |Select *Authorization Code*.
|*Assignments* |Select *Limit access to selected groups*.
|*Selected group(s)*|Enter the name of the group who should have access to the application.
|===
. Configure a custom groups claim filter that the application will send.
.. From the *Sign On* tab, click *Edit** from the OpenID Connect ID Token* section.
.. From *Groups claim type*, select *Filter*. 
.. From *Groups claim filter*, enter `groups`.
.. Select *Matches regex for the expression* then enter *.** for wildcard.

== Configure an Authentication Provider for Salesforce Using OpenID Connect
You set up the auth provider or SSO settings in Salesforce with the identity provider application information.

. From the OpenID Connect application, get these configuration values:

* *Client ID*
* *Client Secret*
* *Authorize Endpoint URL*
* *Token Endpoint URL*
* *User Info Endpoint URL*

. Follow the instructions in https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.sso_provider_openid_connect.htm&type=5[Configure an Authentication Provider Using OpenID Connect^] from the Salesforce documentation using the identity provider configuration for OpenID Connect and complete the following fields from the *Define an Authentication Provider in Salesforce* section:

. Click *Save*. 

== Configure the Redirect URIs for the Portal
To configure the redirects, use your 15 digit organization ID and 18 digits org ID and add a URL for each organization ID.
In the Okta application, select the *General* tab.
Add the following URLs for *Sign-in redirect URIs*:    

* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${15DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${18DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.site.com/aeh/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}

To get the URLs:
* For salesforceOrganizationId, go to *Setup > Company Information*.
* For authProviderURLSuffix, go to *Setup > Auth Providers*, click your auth provider, and select *URL Suffix*.
* For domain, go to *Setup > My Domain > Current My Domain URL*.

=== Create and Configure an Application Using Okta SAML

[%collapsible]
====
Create and Configure an Application Using Okta SAML
Create a new application for the API Experience Hub portal in the identity provider using SAML. For more information, see https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_saml.htm[Create SAML app integrations^] in the Okta documentation.

. From Okta, create an SAML application.
. In *General Settings*, enter a name for your SAML application.
. Select *Do not display application icon to users*.
. Click *Next*.
In *SAML Settings*, complete the following fields:
+
[%header,cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Field|Value
|Single Sign-On URL |enter the URL for the portal login.
|Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL|Select this option.
|Audience URI (SP Entity ID) |enter https with the Salesforce domain or example, https://{salesforcedomain}.com.
|Name ID format |EmailAddress
|Application username |Okta username
|Update application username on |Create and update
|===

. In the *Attribute Statements (optional)* section, configure SAML integration by adding the following custom attributes:
+
[%header,cols="1a,2a,3a"]
|===
|Name|Name format|Value
|*first_name* |*Unspecified* |*user.firstName*
|*last_name* |*Unspecified* |*user.lastName*
|*email* |*Unspecified* |*user.email*
|*groups* |*Unspecified* |*(",", getFilteredGroups({"00gdkat3p5RCvkQQC5d7", "00gdjgk337kYDxtE35d7"}, "group.name", 40))*
|===
The example IDs 00gdkat3p5RCvkQQC5d7, and 00gdjgk337kYDxtE35d7 correspond to the groups that you want to send. Ensure that you send all Anypoint groups when you are configuring Okta in both Salesforce and Anypoint. Otherwise, the user may lose access.
. Click *Next*.
. Select *I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Select the *Assignments* tab and select *Groups*.

[[add-identity-provider]]
== Step 2: Add Salesforce Identity Providers 
After the identity provider is configured for Salesforce, add and enable the identity provider from the API Experience Hub UI. When the identity provider is enabled, users can log in to the portal using this identity provider.

. Go to *API Experience Hub*.
. From the *User management* page, select the *Login settings* tab.
. From the *Single sign-on (SSO)* section, scroll down to step 2 *Add Salesforce identity providers*.
. Click *Select identity provider* and select an option from the dropdown menu and click *+ Add identity provider*.
. Move the slider to *Enabled*.

[[add-group-mapping]]
== Step 3: Add Group Mappings 
When setting up SSO for the portal, your users must have an identity in both Salesforce and Anypoint. SSO users are mapped to teams using their group names. You must map your users to teams using Access Management. API Experience Hub provides an out-of-the-box team called *AEH Portal - ${salesforceOrganizationId}_${salesforceCommunityId}* and is added automatically as a team in Access Management.

Add group mappings by adding the user to the corresponding profile in API Experience Hub:

. Go to *Access Management* > *Teams*.
. Click *AEH Portal Guests* and click *AEH Portal Members*.
//screenshot placeholder
. Click *External IdP Groups*.
//screenshot placeholder
. From the *Group Name* field, enter *AEH Members*.
. From the *Provider Name* field, select the name of the corresponding Salesforce identity provider.
. From the *Type* field, select *Member* and click *Add*.
. Click *Save Changes*.
+
The SSO users associated with the group you designated are assigned to the team.

[[test-sso]]
== Step 4: Test the SSO Configuration
Verify that the SSO for the portal is configured properly.

. Add a user to your identity provider to test the configuration.
.. From *Add Person*, enter the following fields:
+
* User type 
* First name
* Last name
* Primary email
* Groups
.. From *Activation*, select *Activate now*.
.. Select *I will set password*, and enter the password.
.. Click *Save*.

. In a browser, open an incognito window.
. Go to your API Experience Hub portal.
. Select the SSO option that you configured.
. Log in with a user that belongs to the group you configured in the identity provider for your portal.
. Go to *Access Management* and select *Users*. 
. Search using the username to confirm that the user is mapped to the expected identity provider.
. Go to the team with the configured group mappings. 
+
From the *Members* tab, you should see your user there.
