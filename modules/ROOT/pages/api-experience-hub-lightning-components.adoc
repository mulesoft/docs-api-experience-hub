You can design the pages of your API Experience Hub portal by adding and configuring Lightning web components in the Builder.

These Lightning web components include both the Lightning web components available in all Salesforce Digital Experiences and the API Experience Hub Lightning web components available only in API Experience Hub.

Each API Experience Hub Lightning web component has different configuration options and adds different functionality to the portal.

Many API Experience Hub Lightning web components show data from Anypoint Platform. Portal admins can change some of these data fields, such as API names, descriptions, and icons. API Experience Hub saves these changes but does not push the changes back to Anypoint Platform.

To add API Experience Hub components, click the *Components* lightning bolt icon to display the component palette. You can drag any component from the component palette to the current page. Select the component on the page to show the component’s configuration options. You can edit the values by entering or selecting values in the component property fields. 

To delete a component, click the delete icon and click *Delete* from the dialog.

== API Console

The interactive API Console component shows information about your APIs and their methods. Endpoints are displayed in alphabetical order.
+
Console components include API Console, API Console Documentation, API Console Instances, API Console Specification, and API Console Request Panel. In the Builder, you can add multiple console components to the same page. Changes to a console component are visible in all other console components on that page that display the same API. For example, selecting the Summary tab in an API Console results in Summary tab selection in all API Consoles on the same page that display the same API.
+
The component shows the public API instances and documentation from Anypoint Exchange.

== Asset Detail Header

The Asset Details Header component displays the API header, including icon, name, contact email, and description.

The API icon, name, and description shown are set in the API Experience Hub control panel when you add an API version to your community. The contact email is set in Anypoint Exchange.

//You can enter or select the following Asset API Header properties:
//
//* Record id
//* Show API Contact
//* Show API Clients
//* Show instance URL
//* Show categories
//* Show tags

== Asset Version 

Shows the API version from Exchange when only one version is visible.

== Version State

Shows the API version lifecycle state.
* Asset Documentation Viewer

The API Documentation Viewer component shows an API’s documentation from Anypoint Exchange. The documentation can have multiple pages, and each page can have multiple sections.

== Assets Carousel

The API Carousel component shows a horizontally scrollable set of API cards that displays on the Home page. Each card shows an API.

You can specify values for the following Assets Carousel properties:

* Title
+
Title of the carousel.
* Subtitle
+
A subtitle that displays after the title of the carousel.

* Cards to display
+
The number of API cards to display in the carousel. The carousel can display a minimum of three cards and a maximum of fifteen cards. If the number of cards to display is five and the portal has only three APIs, then the carousel displays three cards instead of five.

=== Edit the Titles in the API Carousel
You can modify the title and subtitle that appear for the API Carousel. You can also show the number of cards in the subtitle by entering the `{numberOfAssets}` variable in the *Subtitle* field. For example, *Latest APIs added {numberOfAssets}*. The following image shows the subtitle as *Latest APIs added 5* since the variable displays the number selected in the *Cards to display* field.

With the catalog, users can view and explore large numbers of API versions.
