== User Registration
The User Registration tab lets you disable or enable self-registration for external users. Self-registration enables guest users to register themselves as members of your API portal. From the Pending requests tab, you can see a list of pending requests from guest users who want to access your portal. 

=== Disable or Enable Self-Registration
By default, external users have the ability to self-register to become a member and access your portal site. Administrators can disable self-registration.

To disable external user registration, from the *User Registration* tab of the *User Management* page, turn on the *Disable external user registration* option. 

To enable external registration again, turn off the *Disable external user registration* option.
