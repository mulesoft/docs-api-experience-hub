When you are done managing and curating your portal, you can publish it for your users. The URL for the portal is not accessible until the portal is published. When you publish your site for the first time, the portal URL is live and login access is enabled.

To publish the portal, follow these steps:

. From the *Manage Your API portal* page, click *Preview portal in Salesforce Builder*.
. Click *Builder*.
. Click *Settings* > *General*.
. Check *Public can access the community*.
. Click *Builder*.
. Click *Publish*.

You receive an email confirmation when your changes are live. The email contains the URL link to the published site.
