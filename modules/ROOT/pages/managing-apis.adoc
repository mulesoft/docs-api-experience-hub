From the *API management* page, curate your portal by viewing information about an API from Exchange, adding or removing APIs, and changing the visibility of an API version.

The portal supports the following API types:

* AsyncAPI
* HTTP
* REST
* SOAP

The *API management* page shows the following information:

* *APIs in the portal* 
+
Shows the APIs that have been added to your portal. Administrators can only add APIs for which they have the Exchange Viewer permission. For more information, see xref:assigning-administrator-permissions.adoc[Assigning Administrator Permissions]. When APIs are added to the portal, all administrators are automatically assigned the Exchange Viewer permission. By default, the visibility of the APIs is set to Administrators. The administrator of the portal can change this visibility for each API in the *APIs in the portal* tab. These APIs can also be removed. 
+
You can have a maximum of 350 APIs in your portal. 

* *APIs in Exchange*
+
Shows the APIs that exist in your Exchange organization but have not been added to your portal.

//You can view the description of an API by clicking the down arrow for an API name in the list:

== View APIs in Exchange
You can view information about an API directly from Exchange to determine whether you want to add the API in your portal.

From the *APIs in Exchange* tab, select an API from the list, click more the options icon, and select *View in Exchange*.

== Add APIs from Exchange
Curate your portal in API Experience Hub by adding APIs from Exchange. You must have APIs in Exchange before you can add them to your portal. When adding APIs to the portal, the default visibility is Administrator. You can change the visibility to include members or everyone. See <<make-api-versions-visible,Make API Versions Visible>> for more information.

To add APIs to your portal:

. From the *API management* page, select the *APIs in Exchange* tab.
. To search for an API by name or description, enter the name or description into the *Search* bar.
. Locate the API in the list, click *+ (Add to the portal)*.
+
The API displays in the list in the *APIs in the portal* tab.

== Remove APIs from the Portal
To remove APIs from your portal:

. From the *API management* page, select the *APIs in the portal* tab.
. To search for an API, enter the name, description, category, or tag keyword into the *Search* box.
. Locate the API in the list and click the trash can (Remove from the portal).
. Click *Confirm*.
+
In the *APIs in the portal* tab, the API is removed from the list.

== Make API Versions Visible
By default, when you add a new API, the minor version shared with an Administrator is the latest version of the API. The API instance visibility is set to Public instances. Only the API instances that are public in Exchange are available for end-users to request access to them.

You can manage which version of an API a user can view in your portal. You can set the visibility to Administrators, Members and user groups, Guests, or None.

* Administrators 
+
Use this option if you want the version to be seen by the portal administrator only.
* Members 
+ 
Use this option if you want the version to be seen only by logged-in members or specific user groups.
* Guests
+
Use this option if you want the version to be publicly available to anyone.

* None
+
Don't select any users if you don't want the version to be seen by anyone.

If the visibility is Guests, Members, or user groups, consumer developers can see the new API version in the API Carousel of the portal.

To edit the user visibility that displays for an API:

. From the *API management* page, select *APIs in Portal*.
. To search for an API, enter the name, description, category, or tag keyword into the *Search* box.
. Locate the API in the list and click *Edit visibility*.
. Select an API instance option:
+
* All instances - End-users can't request access to the API.
* Public instances - End-users can request access to the API. 
. Expand an API version and select the users who can see the API.
. Click *Save*.

== Next Steps
From xref:managing-users.adoc[User Management], you can view and manage users and access requests from guest users.
