//API Experience Hub has a more modern, reliable, and flexible portal experience that is achieved through the migration of Salesforce Lightning Web Components. API Experience Hub reduces the complexity of Salesforce configuration and provides a simple API portal creation experience. The API Console is redesigned to be more intuitive for developers, product managers, and other roles for the exploration and consumption of APIs. Moving the major administrative tasks and user management directly onto Anypoint makes it easier for administrators to manage their portals.

The following users can get started with these tasks: 

*Portal administrators*:
