If you encounter errors, refer to the following instructions for recovery.

== Contact MuleSoft Support
For professional services customizations, enhancement requests, and other assistance, contact your MuleSoft Customer Success representative.

To report issues or defects in API Experience Hub, submit a support case through the MuleSoft support portal, available at https://help.mulesoft.com.

The MuleSoft support team works closely with the Salesforce support team to coordinate work on any support tickets involving Salesforce technology.

Service-level agreements (SLAs) for support are available at the xref:https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/support-maintenance-terms?_gl=1*9coixf*_ga*MTc1Mzc4OTg5Mi4xNjc3ODY5OTkw*_ga_HQLG2N93Q1*MTY4NTk5MDc4My4yNDAuMS4xNjg1OTkwODE0LjAuMC4w[MuleSoft Product Support and Maintenance Terms] page.

== Cannot Access the API Management Page to Disconnect Portal
From the API Management, Settings page, you can disconnect your portal. If you cannot access the Settings page, you can disconnect the portal using the following Curl commands to unlink your Anypoint and Salesforce organization. You can execute the commands in a terminal or using Postman and other applications.

The unlinking process deletes the configuration created during the linking process, connected apps, and IDPs in the Anypoint organization. This process does not delete your portal or uninstall the API Experience Hub package. Use this method if you want to create a portal using another Salesforce organization with the same Anypoint account.

To disconnect your portal:

. Get a token from Anypoint:
+
* For US users, use this:
+ 
[source,curl]
----
curl --location --request POST 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"username": "Username",
"password": "Password"
}
' 
----
* For EU users, use this:
+
[source,curl]
----
curl --location --request POST 'https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"username": "Username",
"password": "Password"
}     
'
----
. Extract the token from this:
+ 
[source,curl]
----
{
 "access_token": "TOKEN",
 "token_type": "bearer",
 "redirectUrl": "/home/"
}
----
. Get the connection ID from this request:
+
[source,curl]
----
curl --location --request GET 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/api-experience-hub/api/v1/connections' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [INSERT TOKEN HERE]'
----
+ 
For EU users, use `https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` in the request. 
. Extract the connection ID from this:
+
[source,curl]
----
[
 {
 "createdDate": "2022-12-06T17:27:53.705+00:00",
 "environment": "SANDBOX",
 "id": "[CONNECTION-ID]",
 "organizationId": "******",
 "targetOrganizationDomain": "******",
 "targetOrganizationId": "******",
 "type": "SALESFORCE",
 "updatedDate": "2022-12-06T17:27:53.705+00:00",
 "username": "******"
 }
]
----
. Delete the connection using this:
+
[source,curl]
----
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/api-experience-hub/api/v1/connections/[CONNECTION-ID]' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [INSERT TOKEN HERE]' 
----
+
The connections is deleted. You can perform a new connection to another Salesforce organization. We recommend deleting the browser cache or using a new incognito browser to have a fresh environment to start the linking process again.

== API Experience Hub does not display on Anypoint Platform Landing Page
If API Experience Hub does not display on the Anypoint Platform landing page, ensure that you are using the main organization. Contact the Mulesoft administrator to ensure that the entitlement is enabled.

== Error Occurs When Relax IP Restrictions Option for IP Relaxation is Changed

In this release, IP restrictions for the connected app are not supported. By default, the IP Restrictions field is set to `Relax IP Restrictions`. If you have Trusted IP Ranges in your organization, they are bypassed by the connected app. To avoid errors, do not change the *IP Restrictions* field is from `Relax IP Restrictions` because it produces errors when creating the portal. 

== Error Saving Changes to the Portal When an Object has Validation Rules Activated

An error occurs when saving styling changes to the portal if an object has validation rules applied for standard objects that are created during the Salesforce linking process. 

The workaround is to deactivate the validation rule, save the styling changes, then reactive the validation rule. 

. Navigate to *Setup* > *Object Manager*.
. Select *Validation Rules*.
. Search for the object with the validation rule.
. Click *Edit* next to the rule you want to deactivate.
. Deselect the *Active* checkbox.
. Click *Save*.
. Navigate back to API Experience Hub and click *Try again* in the error message.
. Click *Save* to save your style selections.
. Repeat steps 1 through 4.
. Select the *Active* checkbox and click *Save*

== Error When Installing the Package During the Connection Process
If you encounter errors while installing the package when connecting to Salesforce process, you can review further details about the deployment status:

. From Salesforce, go to *Setup*.
. Click *Environments*. 
. Click *Deploy*.
. Click *Deployment Status*.
. Review the *Failed* and * Succeeded* sections.

== Linking Process Fails
The linking process fails when the user who executes the linking process has the Exchange Contributor role in a business group and this user does not have the System Administrator permission in that same business group. 

To resolve this issue, add the organization administrator permission to the user who is executing the Salesforce linking in the business group.

== Not Receiving Emails from Salesforce Experience Cloud
If you are not receiving emails from Salesforce Experience Cloud, disable the standard configuration by following these steps:

. Go to *Setup* > *Deliverability* > *Email Security Compliance*.
. Unselect *Enable compliance with standard email security mechanisms*.
