You can make your published portal inaccessible to users by deactivating the portal site. The portal is still considered active but it cannot be accessed publicly. You can continue to make changes using the Builder and republish the site later for users to access.

To deactivate your portal site, follow these steps:

. Go to *Setup* > *All Sites*.
. Click *Administration*.
. Click *Settings*.
. Click *Deactivate*.
