The Home page includes the banner image, API portal title, API Carousel, and navigation to APIs by type and serves as the landing page of an API portal. The API Carousel offers API consumers a preview of the most recent APIs added to the portal. Each card contains the API name, icon, type, and description. When selected, developers can view all the information about an API in the API Details page.

The APIs page contains a catalog of all the APIs in the portal. Developers can search and filter the catalog. When selected, each card in the catalog shows the API Details page. 

* API Details

The bottom of the Details page includes the overview and the API documentation. The API overview panel reflects the overview page created by the admin of the API in Exchange. The API documentation panel includes an interactive console for developers to read the API documentation and test the API.
