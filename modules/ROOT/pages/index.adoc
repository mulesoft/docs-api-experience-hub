== Steps to Create a Portal
An administrator can create a custom portal using these easy steps:

. Connect to a Salesforce instance
+
The instance can be a new or existing Salesforce organization. To connect, specify the environment type and enter the custom Salesforce domain if you have one, log in, allow the permissions, and confirm the account.
. Style your API portal
+
Once you are connected to Salesforce, you can style the portal's out-of-the-box pages with logos, fonts, color schemes, and more.
. Manage your portal.
+
Manage APIs by adding APIs from Exchange and setting the visibility for the API versions. Manage users by approving access requests from guest users.
. Publish the portal
+
Publish the portal to make it available to your community.

== Portal Pages
API Experience Hub portal pages include a Home, APIs, and an API Details page. Each page can be configured and customized to fit your organization's needs by the portal administrators. For more information see xref:styling-your-api-portal.adoc[Styling Your API Portal].

The following sample portal shows the Home page:

The portal contains the following template pages:

* Home
+
The Home page includes the banner image, API portal title, API Carousel, and navigation to APIs by type and serves as the landing page of an API portal. The API Carousel offers API consumers a preview of the most recent APIs added to the portal. Each card contains the API name, icon, type, and description. When selected, developers can view all the information about an API in the API Details page.  

* APIs
+
The APIs page contains a catalog of all the APIs in the portal. Developers can search and filter the catalog. When selected, each card in the catalog shows the API Details page. 

* API Details 
+
The top of the API Details page shows the metadata about the API, including the name, description, type, version, lifecycle states, and the email of the contact for the API. The bottom of the Details page includes the overview and the API documentation. The API overview panel reflects the overview page created by the admin of the API in Exchange. The API documentation panel includes an interactive console for developers to read the API documentation and test the API. Developers can read the summary, methods, endpoints, and authorization sections as defined in the API specification. 

== Product Integration
API Experience Hub is integrated with the following products:

* Anypoint Exchange
+
Within API Experience Hub, portal admins can curate their portals by importing APIs from Exchange. Exchange is a catalog of reusable assets such as APIs, policies, API spec fragments, API groups, templates, examples, custom assets, and integration assets such as connectors. See the https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange documentation] for more information.

* Salesforce Experience Cloud
+
API Experience Hub is powered by Salesforce Experience Cloud and provides customization and branding capabilities to serve the different needs of your developer audiences. See xref:customizing-your-portal.adoc[Customizing Your Portal Using Experience Builder] for more information.
