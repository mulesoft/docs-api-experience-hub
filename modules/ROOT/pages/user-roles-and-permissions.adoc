There are roles and permissions that you set in Access Management to manage users with different access levels. API Experience Hub has permissions for administrators, consumers, and Exchange viewers. For more information, see xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Managing Permissions in Access Management].

== Administrator Roles, Permissions, and Profiles
The Organization Administrator role has all of the permissions necessary to create, curate, manage, and customize a portal. This role can also grant another user in their organization the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. This permission enables a user to do all of the same tasks in the portal as the Organization Administrator.

//If there is more than one user who intends to curate and manage the portal, the Organization Administrator can grant another user the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator permission. This administrator has fewer permissions in the portal than the Organization Administrator and the API Experience Hub Administrator.

An API Experience Hub Admin team and an API Experience Hub Portal Admin team is created during the connecting and linking process. Once your Salesforce organization is successfully connected to your Anypoint organization, the AEH Admin team is created. After the Salesforce linking process is complete, any user, who is assigned the AEH Admin, is automatically added to the AEH Admin team. 

Once your styling changes for the portal are saved, the AEH Portal Admin team is created. Although the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator team is visible in Access Management, this permission is not supported in this release.

Administrators can only add APIs for which they have the Exchange Viewer permission. When APIs are added to the portal, all administrators are automatically assigned the Exchange Viewer permission. 

Administrators access the Salesforce Experience Builder with a shared user account. The identity of the administrator is shared therefore, API Experience Hub cannot determine the individual administrator's action in the shared account. 

API Experience Hub is integrated with Salesforce Experience Cloud. The System Administrator profile has specific permissions to perform functions on the Salesforce platform. The user with this profile performs the initial step of creating an API portal by connecting to the Salesforce Experience Cloud and linking theSalesforce organization to the Anypoint organization. This process can only be done by the Salesforce user with the System Administrator profile.

== Consumer Users
API Experience Hub has the following consumer user profiles:

* Guest
* Member

These are groups of users with certain permissions that you can manage using the Teams feature in Anypoint Access Management. Permissions for Guest and Member users are automatically determined by how they access an organization's portal. A user who does not log in to the portal is an anonymous user that is assigned the guest user profile with the permissions assigned to this group. A guest user can become a member by completing the registration process for the portal. Once the user's registration is approved, this user inherits the member user profile and its associated permissions. For more information about Teams in Access Management, see xref:access-management::teams.adoc[Manage User Access Using Teams].
