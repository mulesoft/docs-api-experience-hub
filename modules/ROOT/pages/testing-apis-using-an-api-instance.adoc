The API Console enables you to test an API using an API instance as a server. API instances let you interact with a server by sending requests and getting responses with actual data.

== Before You Begin
You must have an API specification with at least one endpoint and one method in it.

== Test an API Using an Instance

. In the *Home* or the *APIs* page, select a REST API.
. Select the *API specification* tab.
. In the *Specification* pane, click a method like `get`.
. In the *Try it* pane, select an instance URL from the *Select Server* options.
. Enter and query parameters you want to test.
. Click *Send* to send simulated data to the API.
. Verify the returned responses from the API.
