ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Anypoint Platform comes with predefined permissions that you can set in Anypoint Access Management to provide users with different access levels. You can configure the permissions for administrators and Exchange viewers.
 
== Before You Begin
Consider which user in your organization you want to perform the administrator tasks.

== Grant the API Experience Hub Administrator Permission
The Organization Administration and API Experience Hub Administrator can perform all of the functions to create a portal. Only the Organization Administrator can grant a user the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. Grant this permission when you want another user in your organization to perform the Salesforce linking process, create and curate the portal, manage the portal, and manage users.

To grant the API Experience Hub Administrator permission to a user:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform using an account with the Organization Administrator permission.
. Click *Access Management*.
. Click *Users*.
. Click the username of the user that you want to add the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. 
. Select *Permissions* and click *Add Permissions*.
. From the *Select permissions to add for this user* search box, enter *API Experience Hub Amin* and select the checkbox.
. Click the blue plus icon.

//=== Grant the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator Permission 

//If there is more than one users that manages the portal, you can grant another user within your organization the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator permission.

//. From *Access Management*, click *Users*.
//. Click the username of the user that you want to add the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. 
//. Select *Permissions* and click *Add Permissions*.
//. From the *Select permissions to add for this user* search box, enter *API Experience Hub Portal Amin* and select the checkbox.
//. Click the blue plus icon.

== Grant the Exchange Viewer Permission

API Experience Hub Administrators can only add APIs to the portal that they have access to in Exchange. All administrators must have the Exchange Viewer permission to add APIs to the portal.

Once an API is added to the API portal, all admins can view the API in the portal regardless of their access to specific APIs.

To grant the Exchange Viewer permission to a user:

. From *Access Management*, click *Users*.
. Click the username of the user that you want to add the Exchange Viewers permission. 
. Select *Permissions* and click *Add Permissions*.
. From the *Select permissions to add for this user* search box, enter *Exchange Viewers* and select the checkbox.
. Click the blue plus icon.

== Users, Roles, and Permissions
Anypoint Platform comes with predefined roles and permissions that you can set in Access Management to manage users with different access levels. API Experience Hub has permissions for administrators, consumers, and Exchange viewers. For more information, see xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[Managing Permissions in Access Management].

=== Consumer Users
API Experience Hub has the following consumer user profiles:

* Guest
* Member

These are groups of users with certain permissions that you can manage using the Teams feature in Anypoint Access Management. Permissions for Guest and Member users are automatically determined by how they access an organization's portal. A user who does not log in to the portal is an anonymous user that is assigned the guest user profile with the permissions assigned to this group. A guest user can become a member by completing the registration process for the portal. Once the user's registration is approved, this user inherits the member user profile and its associated permissions. For more information about Teams in Access Management, see xref:access-management::teams.adoc[Manage User Access Using Teams].

|===
|User Profile |Description |Actions
|Guest| This userâ€™s profile is anonymous and is not logged in the API portal. 
a|
* View public APIs that are shared with them.
* Can self-register to become a member.
* Cannot request access to APIs. 
|Member|This is a registered user who can log in to a portal.
a|
* View public APIs and other APIs that are shared with them.

=== Administrator Roles and Permissions

The Organization Administrator role has all of the permissions necessary to create, curate, manage, and customize a portal. This role can also grant another user in their organization the API Experience Hub Administrator permission. This permission enables the user to do all of the same tasks in the portal as the Organization Administrator.

//If there is more than one user who intends to curate and manage the portal, the Organization Administrator can grant another user the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator permission. This administrator has fewer permissions in the portal than the Organization Administrator and the API Experience Hub Administrator.

There are two admin teams created
Once your Anypoint organization is linked to your Salesforce organization, an API Experience Hub Admin team is created. Any user who is assigned as the API Experience Hub Administrator is automatically added to this team in Access Management.

Once the portal is created an API Experience Hub Portal Admin team is created. Any user assigned as the API Experience Hub Portal Administrator is automatically added to this team in Access Management. Although this team is visible in Access Management, this permission is not supported in this release.

Administrators can only add APIs for which they have the Exchange Viewer permission. When APIs are added to the portal, all administrators are automatically assigned the Exchange Viewer permission. 

Administrators enter the Salesforce Experience Builder with a shared user account. The identity of the administrator is shared therefore, API Experience Hub cannot determine the individual administrator's action in the shared account. If the administrator is already logged in to the Salesforce organization, their previous session is lost when they click the *Preview portal in Salesforce Builder* button.
