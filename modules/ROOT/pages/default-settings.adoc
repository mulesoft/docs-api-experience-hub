For the pilot, there is no access to guest users. You can disable this access and then delete the permission set assigned to the guest user.

Use the following steps to disable guest user access:

. Open Experience Builder.
. In *Settings* > *General*, uncheck *Guest users can see and interact with the site without logging in*.
. Go to *Setup* > *Sites* and click the community label.
. From the Sites detail page, click Public Access Settings.
+
The Guest User Profile displays.
. Click *Assigned Users*.
. Click *Site Guest User*, *[Community name]*.
. Click *Permission Set Assignments*.
. Delete the *ACM Guest User Permission* set.

Once the API portal is created, it is given an active status. The portal is not live until it is published.
