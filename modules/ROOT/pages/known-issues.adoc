The pilot has the following known issue:

 * Images uploaded from the guided setup may not render correctly if they extend the maximum size for height and width. For more information on size limits for images, see https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_enable_file_limits.htm&type=5[Limit Files in Your Experience Cloud Site].

* The pilot does not use platform cache.
* The *None* API visibility option is currently not supported. For more information about the supported options, see xref:managing-your-portal#make-api-versions-visible[Make API Versions Visible].
* API Experience Hub performs at the main organization level only.
//* You cannot connect a Salesforce organization to more than one Anypoint organization.
+
//To access API Experience Hub from a different Anypoint account, assign the API Experience Hub Admin role from the main org to your chosen user account.


* An Exchange Contributor user in a business group cannot execute the linking process to the Salesforce organization because they do not have the organizational administrator permissions. 
+
To resolve this issue, add the organizational admin for the user who is executing the Salesforce linking in the business group.
