The following list displays known issues and limitations for API Experience Hub:

 * Images uploaded from the guided setup may not render correctly if they extend the maximum size for height and width. For more information about size limits for images, see https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_enable_file_limits.htm&type=5[Limit Files in Your Experience Cloud Site].

* API Experience Hub does not use platform cache.
* The *None* API visibility option is currently not supported. For more information about the supported options, see xref:managing-your-portal#make-api-versions-visible[Make API Versions Visible].
* API Experience Hub functions at the main organization level only.
//* You cannot connect a Salesforce organization to more than one Anypoint organization.
+
//To access API Experience Hub from a different Anypoint account, assign the API Experience Hub Admin role from the main org to your chosen user account.

* The linking process fails when the user who executes the linking process has the Exchange Contributor role in a business group and this user does not have the System Administrator permission in that same business group. 
+
To resolve this issue, add the organization administrator permission to the user who is executing the Salesforce linking in the business group.

* If there are no APIs in Exchange, you cannot complete the API portal creation set up.
