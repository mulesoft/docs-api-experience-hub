A guided design takes portal administrators through the process of styling the API portal using out-of-the-box templates. The guided design contains basic styling options for the Home, API Catalog, and API Details pages with a live preview to help you visualize your portal. Each page includes a progress bar to visualize where you are in the portal design process. 

After the portal is styled and published, you can further customize it using the Experience Builder.


//The guided setup has the following components:

* Style the Home page
