The following topics provide possible causes for single sign-on (SSO) issues and describe how to troubleshoot:

== Missing Redirect URI

A 400 error occurs when logging in to the portal with SSO if the external identity provider application doesnâ€™t have the proper redirect URIs defined.

To troubleshoot this issue, ensure all of the necessary redirect URIs are included:

* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${salesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.site.com/aeh/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}

To get the following redirect URIs:

* salesforceOrganizationId: In Salesforce, go to *Setup > Company Information*.
* authProviderURLSuffix: In Salesforce, go to *Setup > Auth Providers* and select your auth provider URL Suffix.
* domain: In Salesforce, go to *Setup > My Domain > Current My Domain URL*.

== Insufficient Privileges

An insufficient privileges error occurs after logging in to the portal using SSO.

To troubleshoot this issue, publish the portal from the Builder.

. Navigate to *Anypoint Platform*, enter your username and password, and  click *Sign in*.
. From Anypoint Platform, select *API Experience Hub* from the list of products. 
. Go to From the *Manage your API portal* page, click *Preview and publish your portal.
. Click *Publish*. 

== API Carousel Not Loading

After logging in to the portal successfully, you cannot see the APIs in the API Carousel.

There can be a few issues that can cause this error to occur:

* The external identity provider group mapping is missing from Access Management.
* The *Auth provider Default Scopes* field is not configured properly.

=== External Identity Provider Group Mapping Is Missing or Misconfigured

To troubleshoot this issue, add the external identity provider group mapping in Access Management for the portal member user:

. Go to *Access Management* > *Teams*.
. Click *AEH Portal Guests* and click *AEH Portal Members*.
. Click *External IdP Groups*.
. From *Group Name*, enter *AEH Members*.
. From *Provider Name*, select the name of the corresponding Salesforce identity provider.
. From *Type*, select *Member* and click *Add*.

== Auth provider Default Scopes field is Not Configure Properly

To troubleshoot this issue, ensure the *Default Scopes* field has the *profile openid email groups* value.

. In *Salesforce*, go to *Setup*.
. In the *Quick Find* box, enter `Auth`, and then select *Auth Providers*.
. Click *Edit*.
. In the *Auth Provider Detail* section, enter `*profile openid email groups*`.
. Click *Save*.

== Cannot Log In

When trying to log in to the portal with an identity provider, you see a *Problem Logging In* error that the third-party identifier cannot be be found. An incorrect portal URL can cause issues logging in.

To troubleshoot this issue, ensure that the URL is not properly configured. For Okta, the `/userinfo` part of the URL path must be lowercase.
