Ensure you have the required accounts, access, and setup, then start using API Experience Hub.

== Before You Begin

Verify that you have the following required accounts and access:

* Anypoint Platform organization in production
* Salesforce organization
* Organization Administrator of the main organization
* You must either have the System Administrator profile or be a Salesforce user with the AEH_Anypoint permission set assigned in the Salesforce organization that you are connecting to during the linking process. For more information, see xref:assigning-permissions.adoc[].
+
The process of creating your API portal includes connecting with Salesforce Experience Cloud to link your Anypoint Platform organization to your Salesforce organization. 
* API Experience Hub license
* Minimum of 2000 External Identity licenses
+
The current package has a minimum of 100 API access requests which requires a minimum of 2000 External Identity licenses. 

To set up an organization, you can have the following Salesforce editions:

* Unlimited Edition
* Enterprise Edition
* Performance Editions of Salesforce

If you don't have the required accounts and access, issues might occur during the Salesforce linking process when creating your API portal.

== Start Using API Experience Hub

The following users can get started with these tasks: 

*Administrators*:

Administrators can create an API portal in these easy steps:

The instance can be a new or existing Salesforce organization. To connect, specify the environment type and enter the custom Salesforce domain if you have one, log in, allow the permissions, and confirm the account.
