= Use Case 2: Configuring SSO to Use the Identity Provider That is Already Configured for Anypoint 
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Use case two includes instructions for configuring SSO for the portal using an identity provider already configured for Anypoint. 
//The usernames in both organizations match in each identity provider. For example, the Salesforce and Anypoint username is anyuser@salesforce.com. No extra steps to reconcile the usernames are necessary.

Before You Begin

* * An identity provider for Anypoint is already configured.
* In the identity provider of your choice, the user or identity the group of the users who have access to the application have been created. 

== Step 1: Enable SSO for Your Portal
To enable SSO, an identity provider is required for Anypoint to create identities in Anypoint for Salesforce users. 

In this step, you create an application in the identity provider for the API Experience Hub portal, enable the ability to send group information in the application configuration, configure groups, and configure the default identity provider. Performing these steps require you to move back and forth between applications and the identity provider application to copy or add information. 

NOTE: This use case uses Okta as an identity provider as an example of how to enable SSO however, you can use any identity provider.
== Create and Set up An Application Using One of the Following Example Methods:

* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect
* Create and Configure an Application Using Okta SAML


=== Create and Configure an Application Using Okta OpenID Connect

Create a new application for the API Experience Hub portal in the identity provider using OpenID Connect. 

. In Okta, create an OpenID Connect Web application. For more information, see https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm[Create OIDC app integrations^].
. From the *General Settings* section, complete the following fields:
+
|===
|Field|Value
|*App integration name*|Enter a name for the app.
|*Grant type* |Select *Authorization Code*.
|*Assignments* |Select *Limit access to selected groups*.
|*Selected group(s)*|Enter the name of the group who should have access to the application.
|===
. Configure a custom groups claim filter that the application will send.
.. From the *Sign On* tab, click *Edit** from the OpenID Connect ID Token* section.
.. From *Groups claim type*, select *Filter*. 
.. From *Groups claim filter*, enter `groups`.
.. Select *Matches regex for the expression* then enter *.** for wildcard.
+

== Configure an Authentication Provider for Salesforce Using OpenID Connect

You set up the auth provider or SSO settings in Salesforce with the identity provider application information.

. From the OpenID Connect application, get these configuration values:

* *Client ID*
* *Client Secret*
* *Authorize Endpoint URL*
* *Token Endpoint URL*
* *User Info Endpoint URL*

. Follow the instructions in https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.sso_provider_openid_connect.htm&type=5[Configure an Authentication Provider Using OpenID Connect^] from the Salesforce documentation using the identity provider configuration for OpenID Connect and complete the following fields from the *Define an Authentication Provider in Salesforce* section:
+
[%header,cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Consumer Key* |Enter the client ID from the identity provider.
|*Consumer Secret*   |Enter the client secret from the identity provider
|*Authorize Endpoint URL*   | Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize*`.
|*Token Endpoint URL*   |Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token`.
|*User Info Endpoint URL*  |Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo``.
|*Default Scopes*  |*profile openid email groups* 
|*Registration handler*  |*AEHPortalRegistrationHandler* 
|*Execute Registration As*  |Select an administrator user. 
|===

. Click *Save*. 

== Configure the Redirect URIs for the Portal

To configure the redirects, use your 15 digit organization ID and 18 digits org ID and add a URL for each organization ID.

. In the Okta application, select the *General* tab.
Add the following URLs for *Sign-in redirect URIs*:    
+
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${15DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${18DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.site.com/aeh/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}
+
image::aeh-sso-redirect-uris.png[Redirect URIs example]
To get the URLs:
* For salesforceOrganizationId, go to *Setup > Company Information*.
* For authProviderURLSuffix, go to *Setup > Auth Providers*, click your auth provider, and select *URL Suffix*.
* For domain, go to *Setup > My Domain > Current My Domain URL*.



== Map the Portal Application with Anypoint
Configure a custom attribute called anypoint_idp_id and force an update on existing identity provider users to match the identity in the portal to the users in Anypoint. 

If the user already exists and logs in to the portal before the anypoint_idp_id is set, the default identity provider AEH Users - ${salesforceOrganizationId} is used. The user does not get added to the new identity provider specified in the anypoint_idp_id field to prevent the user from being duplicated.

If the user already exists in Salesforce and uses SSO to log in to the portal, the API Experience Hub Member User permission set is assigned to that user if no permission set is assigned.

. In the Okta application, go to Directory > Profile Editor.
. Select the portal application that you just configured.
. Click *Add Attributes* to create a new attribute called anypoint_idp_id.
. Complete the following fields:
+
[%header,cols="1a,2a"]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Display name*|*anypoint_idp_id*
|*Value name*|anypoint_idp_id*
|===
. Save your changes.
. Click *Mappings*.
. Go to *Access Management > Identity Providers*. 
. Click the identity provider and copy and paste the 32 digit ID from the URL into the custom claim anypoint_idp_id thatâ€™s configured in the identity provider.
+

== Step 2: Add Salesforce Identity Providers 
//reused content from partial (ran out of time will do post GA)
After the identity provider is configured for Salesforce, add and enable the identity provider from the API Experience Hub UI. When the identity provider is enabled, users can log in to the portal using this identity provider.

. Go to *API Experience Hub > User management*.
. From the *User management* page, select the *Login settings* tab.
. From the *Single sign-on (SSO)* section, scroll down to step 2 *Add Salesforce identity providers*.
. Click *Select identity provider* and select an option from the dropdown menu. 
. Click *+ Add identity provider*.
. Move the slider to *Enabled*.

== Step 3: Add Group Mappings 
//reused content from partial (ran out of time will do post GA)
When setting up SSO for the portal, your users must have an identity in both Salesforce and Anypoint. SSO users are mapped to teams using their group names. You must map your users to teams using Access Management. API Experience Hub provides an out-of-the-box team called *AEH Portal - ${salesforceOrganizationId}_${salesforceCommunityId}* that is added automatically as a team in Access Management.

Add group mappings by adding the user to the corresponding profile in API Experience Hub:

. Go to *Access Management* > *Teams*.
. Click *AEH Portal Guests* and click *AEH Portal Members*.
. Click *External IdP Groups*.
. From the *Group Name* field, enter *AEH Members*.
. From the *Provider Name* field, select the name of the corresponding Salesforce identity provider.
. From the *Type* field, select *Member* and click *Add*.
+

. Click *Save Changes*.
+
The SSO users associated with the group you designated are assigned to the team.

[[test-sso]]
== Step 4: Test the SSO Configuration
//reused content from partial (ran out of time will do post GA)
Verify that the SSO for the portal is configured properly.

. In a browser, open an incognito window.
. Go to your API Experience Hub portal.
. Select the SSO option that you configured.
. Log in with a user that belongs to the group you configured in the identity provider for your portal.
. Check the visibility of APIs for the user in the portal.
. Go to *Access Management* and select *Users*. 
. Search using the username to confirm that the user is mapped to the expected identity provider.
. Go to the team with the configured group mappings. 
+
From the *Members* tab, you should see your user there.
