= Configuring SSO to Use the Identity Provider That is Already Configured for Anypoint Platform
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This use case includes instructions for configuring SSO for the portal using an identity provider already configured for Anypoint Platform. This use case also provides instructions for reconciling the xref:enabling-sso-for-your-portal.adoc#username-strategy[username assignment strategy] when the usernames for the portal and Anypoint Platform do not match. 

The instructions in this case are using Okta as an example identity provider however, you can use any identity provider to set up SSO.


== Before You Begin
Ensure you have the following setup:

* An identity provider for Anypoint Platform is already configured.
* The user or the identity of the group of the users who have access to the application have been created in the identity provider. 

== Step 1: Enable SSO for Your Portal
In this step, you create and configure an application in the identity provider for the API Experience Hub portal, enable the ability to send group information in the application configuration, configure groups, and map the application to the identity provider for Anypoint Platform. Performing these steps require you to move back and forth between applications and the identity provider application to copy or add information. 

Configuring custom user attributes or claims for the identify provider ensures that the identity provider and the user information are mapped correctly. For example, the AEHPortalRegistrationHandler requires specific user information from the identity provider to create or update a user. The following required information lists the fields it's extracted from and the supported format:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field|Supported Format
|First Name 
| given_name, first_name, firstname, and firstName
|Last Name 
| family_name, last_name, lastname, and lastName
|Email 
|email, email_address, and emailAddress
|Username 
|preferred_username, federation_identifier, email, sub, and NameId
|Groups | groups
|===

If the required information is not in the supported format, create a new custom attribute or claim with the supported format. For information, see the documentation for the identity provider. 

The following information is optional:

[%header,cols="1a,2a,3a"]
|===
|Field |Description |Support Format
|Anypoint Idp Id|Used to map identities to the specific identity provider in Anypoint Platform. |anypoint_idp_id
|Anypoint Username|This field is used to explicitly specify the Anypoint Platform user when the user's identity already exists in Anypoint Platform, but the username is different than the Salesforce user. |anypoint_username
|===

=== Create and Set up An Application 

Create a new application for the API Experience Hub portal in the identity provider. 

. In Okta, create an OpenID Connect Web application. For more information, see https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps_app_integration_wizard_oidc.htm[Create OIDC app integrations^].
. From the *General Settings* section, complete the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field|Value
|*App integration name*|Enter a name for the app.
|*Grant type* |Select *Authorization Code*.
|*Assignments* |Select *Limit access to selected groups*.
|*Selected group(s)*|Enter the name of the group who must have access to the application for API Experience Hub and Anypoint Platform.
|===
. Configure a custom groups claim filter that the application sends.
.. From the *Sign On* tab, click *Edit** from the OpenID Connect ID Token* section.
.. From *Groups claim type*, select *Filter*. 
.. From *Groups claim filter*, enter `groups`.
.. Select *Matches regex for the expression* then enter *.** for wildcard.

=== Configure an Authentication Provider for Salesforce Using OpenID Connect

You set up the auth provider or SSO settings in Salesforce with the identity provider application information.

. From the OpenID Connect application, get these configuration values:

* *Client ID*
* *Client Secret*
* *Authorize Endpoint URL*
* *Token Endpoint URL*
* *User Info Endpoint URL*

. In *Salesforce*, go to *Setup*.
. In the *Quick Find* box, enter `Auth`, and select *Auth Providers*.
. Click *New*.
. In the *Provider Type* field, select *OpenID Connect*.
. Complete the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Provider Type*|*OpenID Connect* 
|*Name*| Enter a name for the provider.
|*Consumer Key* |Enter the client ID from the identity provider.
|*Consumer Secret*|Enter the client secret from the identity provider.
|*Authorize Endpoint URL*| Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize*`.
|*Token Endpoint URL*|Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/token`.
|*User Info Endpoint URL*|Enter `https://{domainofOktaorg}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo``.
|*Default Scopes*  |*profile openid email groups* 
|*Registration handler*|*AEHPortalRegistrationHandler* 
|*Execute Registration As*|Select an administrator user. 
|===

. Click *Save*. 

=== Configure the Redirect URIs for the Portal

To configure the redirects, use your 15 digit organization ID and 18 digits org ID and add a URL for each organization ID.

. In the Okta application, select the *General* tab.
. Add the following URLs for *Sign-in redirect URIs*:    
+
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${15DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://login.salesforce.com/services/authcallback/${18DigitSalesforceOrganizationId}/${authProviderURLSuffix}
* https://${domain}.my.site.com/aeh/services/authcallback/${authProviderURLSuffix}
+
image::aeh-sso-redirect-uris.png["Redirect URIs example",width=60%]
To get the URLs:
* For salesforceOrganizationId, go to *Setup > Company Information*.
* For authProviderURLSuffix, go to *Setup > Auth Providers*, click your auth provider, and select *URL Suffix*.
* For domain, go to *Setup > My Domain > Current My Domain URL*.

=== Map the Application to the Identity Provider for Anypoint Platform
You must map the identity provider ID with the anypoint_idp_id by adding and configuring a new custom attribute called anypoint_idp_id.  

In the case that usernames for the portal and Anypoint Platform don't match, add another custom attribute called anypoint_username to force an update for existing identity provider users to match the identity in the portal to the users in Anypoint Platform.

To map anypoint_idp_id to with the Anypoint Platform identity provider ID:

. In the Okta application, go to *Directory > Profile Editor*.
. Select the portal application that you just configured.
. Click *Add Attributes* to create a new attribute called *anypoint_idp_id*.
. Complete the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Display name*|*anypoint_idp_id*
|*Value name*|*anypoint_idp_id*
|===
. Save your changes.
. Go to *Access Management > Identity Providers* and click the identity provider.
. From the browser URL, copy the 32 digit ID.
+
image::aeh-sso-32-digit-id.png[32 digit located in the browser URL example] 

. Go to *Okta > Directory > Profile Editor* and click *Mappings*
. Paste the ID into the empty field for the new anypoint_idp_id attribute. The ID must be in quotes.
. From the yellow arrow drop-down menu, select *Apply mapping on user create and update*.
+ 
image::aeh-sso-mapped-anypoint-idp-id-attribute.png["Example of mapped anypoint_idp_id attribute",width=90%]
. Click *Save Mappings*.
. Apply the mappings to all users in the profile.

If the user already exists and logs in to the portal before the anypoint_idp_id is set, the default identity provider AEH Users - ${salesforceOrganizationId} is used. To prevent the user from being duplicated, the user is not added to the new identity provider specified in the anypoint_idp_id field.

If the user already exists in Salesforce and uses SSO to log in to the portal, the API Experience Hub Member User permission set is assigned to that user (if no permission set is already assigned).
 
To reconcile the usernames assignment for a single identity in the portal and Anypoint Platform:

. In the Okta application, go to *Directory > Profile Editor*.
. Select the portal application that you just configured.
. Click *Add Attributes* to create a new attribute called *anypoint_username*.
. Complete the following fields:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field|Value
|*Display name*|*anypoint_username*
|*Value name*|*anypoint_username*
|===
. Save your changes.
. Click *Mappings*.
. In the empty field of the new *anypoint_username* attribute, enter `String.substringBefore(user.login, "@")`. Since Okta usernames are email-based, this expression removes the email domain.
. From the yellow arrow drop-down menu, select *Apply mapping on user create and update*.
+ 
image::aeh-sso-mapped-anypoint-username-attribute.png["Example of mapped anypoint_username attribute",width=90%]
. Click *Save Mappings*.

== Step 2: Add Salesforce Identity Providers 
Enable the Salesforce identity provider from the API Experience Hub UI. When the identity provider is enabled, users can log in to the portal using this identity provider.

. Go to *API Experience Hub > User management*.
. From the *User management* page, select the *Login settings* tab.
. From the *Single sign-on (SSO)* section, scroll down to *Add Salesforce identity providers* section.
. Move the slider to *Enabled* for the Salesforce identity provider you configured in Okta.

== Step 3: Add Group Mappings 
//reused content from partial (ran out of time and will do post GA)
When setting up SSO for the portal, your users must have an identity in both Salesforce and Anypoint Platform. SSO users are mapped to teams using their group names. You must map your users to teams using Access Management. API Experience Hub provides an out-of-the-box team called *AEH Portal - ${salesforceOrganizationId}_${salesforceCommunityId}* that is added automatically as a team in Access Management.

Add group mappings by adding the user to the corresponding profile in API Experience Hub:

. Go to *Access Management* > Teams*.
. Click *AEH Portal Guests* and click *AEH Portal Members*.
. Click *External IdP Groups*.
. From the *Group Name* field, enter *AEH Members*.
. From the *Provider Name* field, select the name of the corresponding Salesforce identity provider.
. From the *Type* field, select *Member* and click *Add*.
+

. Click *Save Changes*.
+
The SSO users associated with the group you designated are assigned to the team.

[[test-sso]]
== Step 4: Test the SSO Configuration
//reused content from partial (ran out of time will do post GA)
Verify that the SSO for the portal is configured properly.

. In a browser, open an incognito window.
. Go to your API Experience Hub portal.
. Select the SSO option that you configured.
. Log in with a user that belongs to the group you configured in the identity provider for your portal.
. Check the visibility of APIs for the user in the portal.
. Go to *Access Management* and select *Users*. 
. Search using the username to confirm that the user is mapped to the expected identity provider.
. Go to the team with the configured group mappings. 
+
From the *Members* tab, Ensure that you can see your user.
